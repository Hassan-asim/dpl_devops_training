## 🎯 Objective Recap
- **Learn TypeScript fundamentals**: Read the official documentation to understand its basic and everyday types.
- **Begin a new course on Modern JavaScript**: Start the "JavaScript Data and Applications" course on Coursera to formalize knowledge of modern syntax and production strategies.
- **Complete Module 1**: Work through all introductory materials, labs, and quizzes for the first module of the course.
- **Document architectural research**: Format and save research notes on building a multi-tenant chatbot for Microsoft Teams.

> Today's focus was a mix of foundational programming theory and practical architectural documentation. The goal was to build up TypeScript knowledge, get familiar with a new course structure, and formalize research findings.

## 🔷 TypeScript Fundamentals

I started my TypeScript journey by going through the official handbook. My focus was on the foundational concepts that underpin the language.

### 1. The Basics & Everyday Types
From the [official handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html), I covered:
- **Core Basic Types**: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
- **Arrays**: How to define typed arrays (e.g., `number[]`).
- **`any`**: The escape hatch from the type system.
- **Type Annotations on Variables**: Explicitly setting types with `: type`.
- **Functions**: Typing parameters and return values.
- **Object Types**: Defining the shape of objects with property names and types.
- **Union Types**: Combining types with the `|` operator (e.g., `string | number`).
- **Type Aliases**: Creating custom names for types using `type`.

The image below confirms the setup of the development environment by globally installing TypeScript.

## 🎓 Coursera: JavaScript Data and Applications

To strengthen my JavaScript skills, I enrolled in and began the "JavaScript Data and Applications" course.

### Module 1 Completion
I successfully completed the first of four modules. The content provided a great overview of modern JavaScript in a production context.

**Topics Covered in Module 1:**
- **Video:** Introduction to JavaScript Data and Applications Course (3 min)
- **Reading:** Course Syllabus (30 min)
- **Video:** Modern JavaScript in Production (6 min)
- **Lab:** Modern Syntax Practice (25 min)
- **Dialogue:** Modern JavaScript Strategy (15 min)
- **Video:** Introducing the Restaurant Ordering System Final Course Project (3 min)
- **Lab:** Restaurant Menu System Implementation (45 min)
- **Practice Assignment:** Practice Quiz: Modern JavaScript Implementation

## 🏗️ Architectural Research: Multi-Tenant Chatbot

I also dedicated time to documenting a high-level design for a multi-tenant chatbot platform. The research covers objectives, architecture, scaling strategies, and governance.

The complete, formatted document is available for review:
- **[Multi-Tenant Chatbot Research](./multi_tenant_chatbot_research.md)**

## 🔑 Key Learnings Summary

- **TypeScript provides strong static typing** that can catch errors early and improve code readability and maintainability. The basic types and union types are powerful initial tools.
- **Modern JavaScript involves more than just syntax**: It includes a strategy around tooling, production environments, and project structure, as highlighted in the Coursera course.
- **Architecting for multi-tenancy requires careful planning** around data isolation, resource provisioning, and scalability. Using namespaces in a shared vector database is a cost-effective starting point.

## ✅ Evidence Checklist
- All learning activities are documented in the sections above.
- The `README.md` is structured to match the format of previous daily reports.
- **Screenshot evidence** of TypeScript installation is included and stored in the `images/` directory.
- **External learning resources** (TypeScript Docs, Coursera) are linked directly.
- The **internal research document** is formatted and linked within the report.
