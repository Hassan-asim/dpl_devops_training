## 🎯 Objective Recap
- Worked on the CloudFormation practice task assigned by the PO: created an initial CloudFormation template (`AWSTemplateFormatVersion 2010-09-09.yaml`) and added supporting screenshots and certificates.
- Collected visual evidence of the work in `2025-12-31/images/` (template parts, validation screenshots, and course/certificate images).

## 🛠️ Study / Work Environment
- **Host OS:** Windows
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Terminal:** PowerShell

## 📚 Notes & Key Learnings
- **Template file:** `AWSTemplateFormatVersion 2010-09-09.yaml` (CloudFormation skeleton used for practice and iterative improvement).
- **Core sections prepared:** Parameters, Mappings, Resources, Outputs; placeholders added for real resources and modularization.
- **Validation:** Local syntax checks performed; added screenshots showing template parts and validation steps.
- **Evidence:** Certificates and course screenshots saved in `2025-12-31/images/` (see image list below).

## ✅ Daily Summary
- Completed the initial CloudFormation practice template as assigned by the PO and uploaded supporting screenshots and certificates to `2025-12-31/images/`.
- Next steps: review template with the PO, add resource-level details (VPC, subnets, security groups, auto-scaling group), run a test deployment in a sandbox account, and iterate based on feedback.
