## 🎯 Objective Recap
- Studied **AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO / IAM Identity Center)** by reading the official AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html
- Watched an **in-depth YouTube video** covering AWS SSO concepts and usage (video link not saved).

---

## 🛠️ Study Environment
- **Host OS:** Windows
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Terminal:** PowerShell

---

## 📚 Notes & Key Learnings
- **What AWS SSO / IAM Identity Center is:** A centralized service to manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and supported business applications.
- **Core concepts learned:** Identity source (built-in or external IdP), users & groups, permission sets (reusable permission policies assigned to accounts), account assignments, and session duration.
- **Integration:** Supports external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and can integrate with enterprise IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, etc.).
- **Permissions model:** Permission sets map to IAM roles in target accounts and simplify cross-account access management.
- **Observability & audit:** Actions and changes can be tracked using CloudTrail logs for auditing access and assignments.

---

## ✅ Daily Summary
- Completed reading the AWS Single Sign-On user guide and supplemented it by watching a detailed YouTube walkthrough to reinforce conceptual understanding.
- No screenshots or images were added for today.
- Next steps: create a hands-on lab to configure IAM Identity Center for a small multi-account sandbox to practice permission sets and assignments, then document configuration steps and add screenshots.
