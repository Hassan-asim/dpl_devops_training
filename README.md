This repository now tracks my DevOps practice in **date-wise folders** so you can review each day’s progress, artifacts, and supporting documents in one place. I’ll continue to mirror this structure for future evaluations and test projects you share in the same folders.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `YYYY-MM-DD/` – A dedicated folder for that day’s work. Each contains:
  - `README.md` – the full daily report (study log, challenges, fixes, screenshots).
  - `images/` – screenshots embedded in the daily README.
  - Any practice assets (`user-data`, `meta-data`, `seed.iso`, scripts, etc.).

### Available Logs

| Date       | Highlights                                                          |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-11-21 | Amazon Linux 2 VirtualBox setup, cloud-init seed ISO, study summary |

navigate into the date folder you want to review—for example:

```
cd 2025-11-21
```

You’ll find the detailed README plus every artifact referenced.

## 🔄 Next Steps

- I’ll keep uploading new days exactly the same way.
- Feel free to drop evaluations or project briefs inside the relevant date folder; I’ll respond in-place.

Let me know if you’d prefer a different naming scheme or extra metadata (e.g., time logs, task checklists) in each folder.***
