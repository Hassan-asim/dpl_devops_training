# dpl_devops_training

This repository now tracks my DevOps practice in **date-wise folders** so you can review each day’s progress, artifacts, and supporting documents in one place. I’ll continue to mirror this structure for future evaluations and test projects you share in the same folders.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `YYYY-MM-DD/` – A dedicated folder for that day’s work. Each contains:
  - `README.md` – the full daily report (study log, challenges, fixes, screenshots).
  - `images/` – screenshots embedded in the daily README.
  - Any practice assets (`user-data`, `meta-data`, `seed.iso`, scripts, etc.).

### Available Logs
